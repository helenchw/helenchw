A developer who is interested in distributed systems with a special focus on data storage systems :wrench:

I was a maintainer of the [Linux Foundation Edge Nexoedge project][lf_edge_nexoedge_project_space] between Aug 2023 and Jun 2025. 
Nexoedge is a reliable and storage-efficient multi-cloud storage system with network-coding-inspired data repair optimization. It aims to transparently connect edge applications to a reliable data storage pool over multiple private/public clouds, e.g., for long-term data archival.

I also worked on a few research projects on storage system reliability and performance during my graduate studies :books:. The project list is available at [my personal website][my_website].

In my spare time, I like to exercise :running_woman: and do light readings :book:. I also take part in volunteer service in the hope to meet different people in the community and contribute to the community :people_holding_hands:.
